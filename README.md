# Hi, I'm Manon 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🔬 I'm a neuroscience researcher, specializing in signal processing and artificial intelligence.

🧠 My current projects focus on:
1. Understanding the impact of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on cognitive development in children with epilepsy;  
2. Detecting epileptic seizures from audio recordings.

📚 Interests:
- Cognitive and clinical neuroscience  
- Signal processing (EEG - Audio)  
- AI applied to health (ML/DL, prediction, anomaly detection)

📍 Based at the Laboratory of Signal and Image Processing (LTSI) in Rennes, France

🎓 Recently graduated as a Data Scientist specialized in Artificial Intelligence (Datascientest - Mines Paris, 2025)
